export const SENTINEL1_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION = `<p>Sentinel-1 is a spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging system and mission from the European Space Agency and the European Commission. The mission launched and began collecting imagery in 2014.</p><p>With the ability to see through cloud and smoke cover, and because it does not rely on solar illumination of the Earth's surface, Sentinel-1 is able to collect useful imagery in most weather conditions, during both day and night. This data is good for wide range of land and maritime applications, from mapping floods, to deforestation, to oil spills, and more.</p><p>The Sentinel-1 RTC analysis ready archive is available in <a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/">ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World</a> as a dynamic time enabled image service, accessible across the ArcGIS system. For more about the service and data, see <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ca91605a3261409aa984f01f7d065fbc">Sentinel-1 RTC</a>.</p>`;
