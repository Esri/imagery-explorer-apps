                    Jointly managed by NASA and the USGS, Landsat is the longest
                    running spaceborne earth imaging and observation program in
                    history. The Landsat program began in 1972, with the launch
                    of Landsat 1. Beginning with Landsat 4, the program began
                    providing mission to mission data continuity.
