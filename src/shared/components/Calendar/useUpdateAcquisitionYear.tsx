/**
 * This custom hook is triggered whenever the user-selected acquisition date changes.
 * It updates the user-selected year based on the year from the selected acquisition date.
 * In animation mode, the newly added frame utilizes the year inherited from the previous animation frame, if available.
 *
 * Why is this necessary? For instance, in Swipe Mode, when the user has two scenes selectedâ€”
 * one acquired in 1990 and another in 2020, switching between these scenes should update the calendar
 * to display scenes available from the year of the selected scene. Without invoking this hook,
 * the acquisition year won't update when users switch scenes. The same logic applies to animation mode.
 * In other words, the calendar should always reflect available scenes from the acquisition year based on the user-selected scenes.
